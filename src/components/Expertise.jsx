                                        Frontend Development means creating the part of a website or web application that the user directly sees and uses. Making the website fast and user-friendly. Design, colors, layout, animations
                                        and Creating responsive designs that make websites interactive and work well on all devices.

                                        As a Designer, I design modern, responsive websites that work beautifully on all devices.
                                        As a Developer, I write clean and effective code using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React. 
                                        As a communicator, I work in constant contact with clients.
                                        I can efficiently manage a project from start to finish. I work as a Planner, Designer, Developer, and Communicator at the same time.

                                        Frontend developers usually have four types of content. We usually provide educational content, where simple explanations are given regarding HTML, CSS, JavaScript or React. And we also address common problems faced by clients.

                                        In addition, the portfolio highlights what has changed before and after the project. Trust-building content, which explains the work process, client communication, and delivery system.
